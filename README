Table component 0.1

This component creates a 'simple table' that is accessible and has
caption, summary and other accessibility features. Also it supports
column highlighting and clickable cells out of the box to improve
usability.

For complex tables e.g. with header/id relations or nested tables, you might need to tweak or use another component.

For advanced features like sorting, paging & filtering, this component
may be very well used in combination with datatables.net.

Documentation:
opts.rows expects an object containing array of arrays of cells (each representing a row) for example [['<td class="id">1</td>','<td class="name">Ray</td>']['<td class="id">2</td>','<td class="name">Mark</td>']]

OR if you want to provide the row too (e.g. including classnames or other attributes), pass the TR attribute string as a second value of the row array:
[
  [
    ['<td class="id">1</td>','<td class="name">Ray</td>']
    ['<td class="id">2</td>','<td class="name">Mark</td>']
    ,
     'class="x" rel="y" tabindex="0"'
  ]
]
